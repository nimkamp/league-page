  <p>Founded in 2022, Coast 2 Coast Carnage quickly established itself as more than just a fantasy football league — it became a coast-to-coast battlefield. From the Pacific to the Atlantic, managers entered with one goal in mind: total domination.</p>
  <p>In Carnage, there are no keepers, no dynasty stashes, and no excuses. Every season is a fresh start and a clean slate — or at least it would be, if everyone didn’t remember who auto-drafted a kicker in the 8th round last year. The draft is sacred, and every August, managers gather to build a championship roster from scratch, armed with spreadsheets, gut feelings, and way too much confidence.</p>
  <p>Each manager has their own style. Some play it safe with high floors and proven vets. Others swing for the fences, praying their breakout sleepers don’t turn into waiver wire fodder by Week 3. Injuries, busts, and unexpected bye week disasters are all part of the game — but so is redemption, comebacks, and the sweet, sweet satisfaction of a well-timed victory.</p>
  <p>Smack talk is the league’s second language, and no win goes uncelebrated — or unmocked. Whether it’s meme warfare in the group chat or Monday night heartbreaks, Coast 2 Coast Carnage is as much about pride as it is about points.</p>
  <p>Each season ends with one manager winning the chip and pocketing the prize money, while the rest are left to wonder what went wrong (again). The last-place finisher? Well, their name goes down in infamy — and depending on league tradition, maybe their dignity too.</p>
  <p>Year after year, the competition only gets fiercer. New draft strategies emerge. Rivalries intensify. And just when you think you’ve figured it all out — you finish 9th.</p>
  <p>So welcome to Coast 2 Coast Carnage. May your picks hit, your players stay healthy, and your Monday nights be merciful.</p>
